        <h3>Design Statement</h3>
        <p>As a designer, I love art history and inspired a lot by it. I think art history is loop. At the time before
            medieval, ancient people drew awkward figures in order to laud their monarch. When it was medieval and
            Renaissance, lenses were invented, so the artists paid their attentions to copying precisely from reality
            with the help of lenses. However, at modern ages, artists divert their attention to other things instead of
            copying the reality because of the invention of camera.
            ​
            Therefore, I strongly believe that it is the idea of an art work instead of the form that is more important.
            Although the form and how the art work looks like determine if the audiences will notice it at once and have
            interest in it, the connotative meaning decides if the audience will remember it, or even the art work will
            effect people. As an modern artist, I keep this in my mind and spend lots of time thinking and probing into
            the essence of things. Meanwhile, didn’t forget the power of first glance, so I also pay attention to
            exploring different materials and technologies. My works are not only eye-catting, but also have deep
            meaning behind the pretty appearances.</p>

            <p class="type_body_1">As a designer, I love art history and inspired a lot by it. I think art history is
                loop.
                At the time before
                medieval, ancient people drew awkward figures in order to laud their monarch. When it was medieval and
                Renaissance, lenses were invented, so the artists paid their attentions to copying precisely from
                reality
                with the help of lenses. However, at modern ages, artists divert their attention to other things instead
                of
                copying the reality because of the invention of camera.
                ​
                Therefore, I strongly believe that it is the idea of an art work instead of the form that is more
                important.
                Although the form and how the art work looks like determine if the audiences will notice it at once and
                have
                interest in it, the connotative meaning decides if the audience will remember it, or even the art work
                will
                effect people. As an modern artist, I keep this in my mind and spend lots of time thinking and probing
                into
                the essence of things. Meanwhile, didn’t forget the power of first glance, so I also pay attention to
                exploring different materials and technologies. My works are not only eye-catting, but also have deep
                meaning behind the pretty appearances.</p>
